    * Droplet support for OSX 10.10


  Release Notes / Changes from 1.18.5 to 1.18.6:

    * krpano HTML5 Viewer (krpano.js)
          o Fix: Support iOS 9 iPhone landscape 'fullscreen' mode.

    * Videoplayer Plugin (videoplayer.js)
          o Fix: Support iOS 9 (autoplay via touch workaround).

    * Soundinterface Plugin (soundinterface.js)
          o Fix: Support iOS 9 (autoplay via touch workaround).

    * Showtext Plugin (showtext.xml)
          o Fix: Empty width/height values in the textstyle were causing
            problems.

    * krpano Tools
          o Fix: Makepano tool - relative config/settings paths without
            directory separator character were parsed wrongly.

    * Droplets
          o Fix: A workaround for the OSX 10.10 droplet bug was added. The
            system was splitting the dropped files into several packages and
            passes them seperately to the krpano tools. As workaround the
            krpano tools will now automatically collect and merge all files
            that were passed within a few seconds.

                 avoid caching).

          o Change: The outdated googlemaps.swf Flash plugin has been finally
                    removed from the download package. Google has disabled the
                    Google Maps Flash API, so that this plugin can't work
                    anymore.

  Release Notes / Changes from 1.17.6 to 1.18:

    * krpano HTML5 Viewer (krpano.js)
          o New: Support panoramic videos when WebGL is available and when
                 using HTML5 videos as WebGL textures is possible and allowed.
          o New: Support (non-tiled, non-multires) spherical or cylindrical
                 or partial pano images when WebGL is available.
          o New: Polygonal hotspot support.
          o New: Contextmenu support for touch devices (enabled by default).
          o New: contextmenu.touch setting for enabling / disabling the
                 contextmenu on touch devices.
          o New: contextmenu.customstyle setting for customizing the
                 contextmenu visual style / look (examples).
          o New: Support the display.currentfps variable.
          o New: Support the multireslevel variable.
          o New: Support the NOPREVIEW loading flag.
          o New: Support the Chrome device simulator.
          o Change: More sensible click detection - allow larger movements
                    between down and up and use a different sensitivity for
                    mouse and touch usage.
          o Change: The default maxmem limit will depend now on the total size
                    of the screen (in a range of 150-400MB). This is better
                    for HiDPI / 4k screens and causes less reloading there.
          o Change: Use hardwarelimit=800 and maxmem=40 by default for
                    iPhone4/4S for more stability.
          o Change: This will be the last version with support for the
                    'jsborder' setting - use container elements and the new
                    bgborder setting instead.
          o Change: Write 'HTML5/Desktop' instead of 'Desktop/Platform' in the
                    contextmenu versioninfo to make it easier to differ
                    between Flash and HTML5.
          o Fix: The ox/oy distances for zoom=true hotspots weren't scaled
                 during zooming.
          o Fix: Slightly more accurate frame-rate for iOS.
          o Fix: Improved support for older low-end Android devices (before
                 Android 4.4 and without WebGL support) - prefer the usage of
                 the mobile/tablet images if available and don't use multires
                 there.
          o Fix: Improved Mipmapping (WebGL) - support mipmapping also for
                 'edge-tiles' that don't have 'power-of-two' sizes as long as
                 the main tilesize is a power-of-two size - and - support
                 mipmapping=force for any usage case.
          o Fix: Support mipmapping also in IE11 when possible.
          o Fix: Wait until the preview pano or the current view (if there is
                 no preview pano) is fully loaded before start blending.
          o Fix: Same layer elements position rounding as in Flash for
                 'centered edges' like edge=left|right|center|top|bottom.
          o Fix: There are situations where it is not possible to detect the
                 release of the mouse button (e.g. over an embedded iframe) -
                 for these situations check in the next available mouse-move
                 event if the mouse button is still pressed and if not,
                 manually trigger the mouse-up event.
          o Fix: Predefine the layer/plugin/hotspot onover, onhover, onout,
                 onclick, ondown, onup, onloaded events to make them directly
                 accessible in local scope code.
          o Fix: Too early onloadcomplete event in flat panos that have a
                 preview pano.
          o Fix: Stop the bouncinglimits friction movement when starting a
                 lookto movement.
          o Fix: When there is only one multires level that is too large to
                 get fully loaded, then send the onloadcomplete event when the
                 current view is fully loaded.
          o Fix: Wrong 'background-size' css style during the plugin loading
                 in some cases (can cause a warning in the browser log).
          o Fix: Avoid the 'wrong' Chrome 'Attr.nodeValue is deprecated' log
                 warning.
          o Fix: Layer and plugin elements with scale=0 or scale9grid with 0/0
                 sizes weren't scaled and aligned correctly.
          o Fix: Workaround for a Chrome touch bug - touching on a <a> link
                 inside a textfield html-text wasn't working.
          o Fix: Workaround for a Chrome CSS3D rendering bug that could cause
                 hidden tiles when the contextmenu is opened.
          o Fix: Automatically correct the inaccurate viewport pixelratio
                 values (due rounded sizes) of some devices for pixel-perfect
                 sharper WebGL rendering.
          o Fix: When no image.type setting was set in the xml, set its value
                 to the auto-detected pano image type.
          o Fix: HTML5 fullscreen mode support for Android Opera.
          o Fix: Wrong distorted hotspot visibility in some cases when using
                 fisheye distortion.
          o Fix: Hide distorted hotspots that are smaller than 256px
                 automatically in Firefox when their center moves 'behind' the
                 screen. This is a workaround for a Firefox CSS3D software
                 rendering bug.
          o Fix: Adjust the hotspot sub-pixel-positions for the textfield
                 plugin to avoid blur texts (especially in Chrome).

    * krpano Flash Viewer (krpano.swf)
          o Change: The polygonal hotspot default settings and hovering
                    behavior have been changed. When the version number in the
                    xml is 1.18 or higher, then the automatic style change on
                    hovering (and so the the hotspot 'fill/border-'*hover'
                    settings) are not supported anymore. This was changed to
                    match the HTML5 version and to provide more control. To
                    change the style of a polygonal hotspot when hovering, the
                    onover/onout events and the tween() action should be used
                    now.
          o Change: Set the Flashplayer 10 rendering quality settings
                    (movequality10 and stillquality10) to BEST by default (for
                    better rounded edges rendering).
          o Change: Use 'lefttop' as default value for the align setting for
                    non-swf files.
          o Change: The old plugin-interface event 'krpano.resizeplugin' will
                    be dispatched 'earlier' now to allow the plugin to change
                    the plugin size directly without the need of an additional
                    frame update.
          o Change: The default setting of image.progressive will be false now
                    to match the behavior of the HTML5 viewer.
          o Fix: The ox/oy distances for zoom=true hotspots weren't scaled
                 during zooming.
          o Fix: When pressing the F5 key, the viewer will send automatically
                 a Javascript call to reload the current webpage. This is done
                 to simulate the intended behavior of the browser because
                 disabling the actual Flashplayer behavior of blocking system
                 / browser keys is not possible.
          o Fix: Adjust local Windows paths that contain 'vertical bar'
                 characters to allow using 'paths with alternatives' (e.g.
                 videoplayer plugin videourl).
          o Fix: Support the AS3 'unloadAndStop' method for unloading
                 Flash/SWF plugins - this would automatically remove
                 everything that was added by the plugin (like video or sound
                 streams).
          o Fix: The loadstyle() action wasn't supporting setter/getter plugin
                 variables.
          o Fix: Catch the case when calling a native action with a wrong
                 count of parameters and report an error about that.
          o Fix: Make container elements also click-able when bgalpha is 0.0
                 and bgcapture is enabled.
          o Fix: The autorotation and the onidle event weren't starting when
                 the viewing range limitation and the maxpixelzoom limitation
                 were both limiting the current view at the same time.
          o Fix: Wrong autorotation zooming when a pano with a smaller fov was
                 loaded before and the autorotate was active.

    * krpano HTML Embedding Script (embedpano.js)
          o New: Additional flash setting for selecting the flash/html5 usage.
                 Works the same as the html5 setting, but just with the
                 inverse functionality.
          o New: initvars setting for setting custom xml url path placeholders.
          o New: Pass automatically the current document (html file) location
                 to the Flash viewer as browser.location variable. This is
                 internally required to be able to calculate the correct paths
                 of video files in the Flashplayer.
          o Change: When using html5=prefer and WebGL support is not
                    available, then still prefer the usage of Flash in the
                    Chrome browser (because of the buggy and partial
                    problematic CSS3D rendering of the Chrome browser).

    * krpano Action / XML Interface (for Flash and HTML5)
          o New: The if() action (and also all other actions that are checking
                 conditions) are supporting AND, OR and ! operators and (...)
                 parenthesis now.
          o New: bgborder setting for adding borders to container layer
                 elements.
          o New: bgroundedge setting for rounded edges on container layer
                 elements.
          o New: bgshadow setting for adding shadows behind and inside
                 (=html5-only) container layer elements.
          o New: Multiple device checks for attributes and a new / additional
                 syntax for the devices attribute (same syntax as the
                 attribute device checking syntax).
          o New: device.multiressupport and device.panovideosupport for
                 checking if the device is capable enough for multires panos
                 or panoramic video.
          o New: device.mouse and device.touch device checks (device.touch is
                 replacing the device.gesturedevice check).
          o New: autorun setting for <action> elements to run them
                 automatically on startup.
          o New: minwidth, maxwidth and minheight, maxheight settings for
                 limiting the resulting layer sizes. Can be useful when using
                 percent values for the width or height settings.
          o New: Multi-variable tween() support - tween several variables
                 together at once.
          o New: Support tweening colors with the tween() action - when
                 tweening a variable with a name that contains the word
                 'color', then automatically interpret the values as 32bit
                 ARGB colors and process them accordingly.
          o New: callwith(caller,actions) action for calling action code with
                 using a specific caller (a plugin/layer or hotspot element)
                 for direct access to its properties (this is like the code
                 was called from an event from that element).
          o New: screentolayer(layer,sx,sy,lx,ly) and
                 layertoscreen(layer,lx,ly,sx,sy) actions for converting
                 positions between screen and relative layer coordinates.
          o New: clamp(var,min,max) action for clamping / limiting the value
                 of a variable to be between given min and max values.
          o New: tohex(var,prefix,length) action for converting numbers to
                 hexadecimal texts (e.g. for html/css colors).
          o New: tolower(var) and toupper(var) actions for converting the case
                 of texts.
          o New: browser.location variable - the url of the current webpage.
          o New: browser.domain variable - the domain of the current webpage.
          o New: 'Overshoot' tween types: easeInBack, easeOutBack and
                 easeInOutBack.
          o New: Make the default 'showtext' action overrideable to allow
                 custom implementations.
          o New: Expose the pixel position of layer elements via pixelx and
                 pixely.
          o New: control.touchzoom setting for enabling / disabling the touch
                 zoom gesture.
          o New: wheeldelta_touchscale variable for more detailed informaton
                 about the current zooming / scaling on touch devices.
          o New: view.mfovratio setting for setting a custom ratio for the
                 MFOV fovtype.
          o Change: When calling the tween() action with a variable that
                    contains get() queries, resolve them first before doing
                    the tween. This makes it possible to use get() queries
                    with variables that will change later for the tween()
                    calls.
          o Change: The view.stereographic setting is enabled by default.
          o Change: The view.pannini setting is now a linear numeric setting
                    from 0.0 to 1.0 instead of a boolean with true and false
                    and can be used for interpolation between enabled and
                    disabled Pannini projection.
          o Change: Slightly changed default preview grid() settings.
          o Change: The actions-per-frame limit ('actions overflow error') was
                    increased from 10.000 to 100.000.
          o Change: Don't show the 'tween type not found' warning anymore when
                    using an invalid tween type.
          o Change: The polygonal hotspot settings fillcolorhover,
                    fillalphahover, borderwidthhover, bordercolorhover,
                    borderalphahover, fadeintime, fadeincurve, fadeouttime,
                    fadeoutcurve are deprecated now. For the moment they are
                    still working in Flash for compatibility reasons, but only
                    when the version number in the xml is 1.17 or lower.
          o Fix: More accurate devices attribute checks - don't check for
                 partial device strings and correctly resolve combined iOS
                 version checks.
          o Fix: The if() action can now differ between variables that are not
                 defined and variables that have the value null.
          o Fix: The videourl paths with 'alternatives' will be now also
                 adjusted to be relative to the xml file.
          o Fix: Avoid script crashes when stopping delayedcalls or tweens
                 during they were processed.
          o Fix: Avoid script crashes when trying to set an attribute of a not
                 existing element.
          o Fix: Avoid conflicts when mixing 'layer' and 'plugin' as element
                 name when tweening the same element.

    * Videoplayer Plugin (videoplayer.swf, videoplayer.js)
          o New: Panoramic video support for HTML5 when WebGL is available.
          o New: Additionally (optional) parameters for the playvideo() action
                 - posterurl, pausedonstart, starttime.
          o New: Support using percent values in the seek() action.
          o New: onvideoplay event - will be sent when the video starts
                 playing.
          o New: videowidth and videoheight variables that are providing
                 information about the source video frame size.
          o New: isseeking and iswaiting state attributes for more information
                 about the current video state.
          o New: preferredformat setting for preferring a specific video
                 format (like mp4 or webm) when several are available and
                 supported.
          o New: Support the loadedbytes and totalbytes state attributes also
                 in HTML5.
          o Change: The videourl path is now relative to the xml file also in
                    Flash. The plugin uses the html file location information
                    provided by the embedding script to calculate the absolute
                    paths automatically.
          o Change: Scale the the video now via CSS 3D transforms - this
                    allows also non-proportional scaling without black borders.
          o Change: The onvideoready event will be called for panoramic videos
                    when the image.hfov and image.vfov values are known.
          o Fix: Better alternative videourl handling - support more video
                 file extensions and automatically try loading the next video
                 when the one previous one has failed.
          o Fix: Detect correctly when having loaded the first frame for
                 pausedonstart=true for panoramic video (Flash).
          o Fix: Correctly set the 'playsinline' settings for iOS (for custom
                 Apps that enable the WebView allowsInlineMediaPlayback
                 setting).
          o Fix: Manually load and show the poster image to skip several
                 browser-related bugs related to the poster image.
          o Fix: Support the iOS 8 related changes (video size detection,
                 video preloading).
          o Fix: No video touch-autostart for iPhone (because of the iPhone
                 fullscreen).
          o Fix: Improved 'need a touch to start the video' detection.
          o Fix: Improved playback state (playing / paused / waiting)
                 detection.
          o Fix: Set the video CSS background automatically to transparent
                 when playing the video to avoid lines around the video in
                 some browsers in some cases.
          o Fix: Improved support for older (and buggy) Android browsers.
          o Fix: The video wasn't paused when using the video as distorted
                 hotspot with pausedonstart=true and visible=false (Flash).

    * Textfield Plugin (textfield.swf, HTML5:integrated)
          o New: Support individual radius values for each edge - roundedge.
          o New: HTML5 - these textfield settings can now be updated without
                 the internal need to rebuild the text: background,
                 backgroundcolor, backgroundalpha, bordercolor, borderalpha,
                 roundedge, shadow*, textshadow*.
                 This improves the performance and more important - it makes
                 it possible to change these settings in the over/out and
                 down/up mouse/touch events without eventually losing some
                 events when they are happening due the text rebuilding.
          o Fix: Update the underline and italic text styles correctly when
                 dynamically changing the css settings (Workaround for a
                 Flashplayer bug).
          o Fix: Make it possible to use an underline CSS style and
                 vcenter=true together in Webkit-based browsers (HTML5).

    * Scrollarea Plugin (scrollarea.swf, scrollarea.js)
          o Fix: Automatically scroll to be within the area after plugin size
                 changes.

    * Bingmaps Plugin (bingmaps.swf, bingmaps.js)
          o New: culturecode setting for custom languages for the map labels.
          o New: mapsapi setting for using different map api urls.
          o Fix: Missing custom spot images when the spots are 'outside the
                 map view' on startup.

    * Googlemaps Plugin (googlemaps.js)
          o New: tilt and heading settings for using rotating 45 degree maps.
          o New: controls setting for enabling or disabling the default Google
                 Maps controls.
          o New: language setting for custom languages for the map labels.
          o New: mapsapi setting for using different map api urls.
          o Fix: Correct spot and radar scaling in older Android browsers.

    * Combobox Plugin (combobox.swf, combobox.js)
          o Fix: Workaround for an iOS 8 bug that causes 'visible lines' in
                 the opened combobox field.
          o Fix: Workaround for a Mac Firefox bug that causes 'visible lines'
                 in the opened combobox field.
          o Fix: Wrong position of the opened combobox field on zoomed pages
                 in Chrome.
          o Fix: Use the mouse 'pointer' cursor for the combobox items.

    * Showtext Plugin (showtext.xml)
          o New: A new xml-only plugin that provides showtext() and extended
                 <textstyle> support for Flash and HTML5.

    * FPS Plugin (fps.xml)
          o New: A new and simple xml-only plugin that shows the current
                 rendering framerate.

    * Gyro Plugin (gyro.js)
          o New: Support Android Chrome, Android Firefox and Windows Phone /
                 IE11.
          o New: Automatically change the display.loadwhilemoving setting to
                 true during enabled gyro (to allow loading multires panos
                 during gyro panning).
          o Change: The camroll setting is enabled by default now.
          o Change: The friction setting is 0.0 by default now.
          o Change: Never set the available attribute and send the onavailable
                    event on older Android browsers, the gyroscope wouldn't
                    work correctly there anyway.

    * Droplets / Templates / Skins / Examples
          o New: Embedded Youtube player example for Flash and HTML5.
          o New: Videoplayer plugin example.
          o New: Added an improved version of the Barrique Vine Cellar Tour to
                 the examples included in the download package.
          o New: Added an animated hotspot to the tooltip example.
          o New: Updated and improved contextmenu.xml.
          o New: defaultskin.xml - Updated and improved contextmenu.
          o New: vtourskin.xml - Updated and improved contextmenu.
          o New: vtourskin.xml - new <skin_settings> - title, thumbs,
                 loadscene_flags, loadscene_blend for easier adjusting the
                 skin behavior.
          o New: vtourskin.xml - make choose-able between Bing and Googlemaps
                 (slightly renamed maps <skin_settings> due this change).
          o New: embedpano.html - Set the iOS web-app status bar color to
                 black by default.
          o Fix: vtourskin.xml - don't make the thumbborder visible when there
                 is no thumb for the current scene.
          o Fix: vtourskin.xml - use area.pixelwidth/area.pixelheight instead
                 of stagewidth/stageheight to allow using the <area> settings.
          o Fix: Improved 'calcaspect' action in the fovtype example.

    * krpano Tools
          o Change: Makepano tool - automatically add devices="html5" in the
                    xml to <level> elements of extremely large mulitres levels
                    (levels with more than 25000 tiles) to avoid a slow
                    startup and too much memory usage in the Flashplayer.
          o Fix: krpano Tools - file paths that were containing a single quote
                 character (') weren't processed correctly in some cases.
          o Fix: Encrypt tool - automatically use the binary Flash-only
                 encryption mode for .swf files - even when the HTML5-
                 compatible encryption mode is enabled.
          o Fix: The tempdir setting wasn't working in all cases.
          o Fix: Transform tool - an internal maximum memory usage limit
                 wasn't checked correctly and that leads to slow system memory
                 swapping in some cases.
          o Fix: Update tool - hanging update dialog when there were no files
                 that could be updated.
          o Fix: Update tool - when updating demo viewer files, set the
                 correct default protection settings.
          o Fix: MakeTiles Tool - Crash when loading tiled tiff files as input.
          o Fix: MakeTiles Tool - Upscaling and tiling at the same time could
                 cause slightly wrong scaled/aligned output tiles with bad
                 lines in the last row tiles.

krpano 1.17.6 / 2014-10-17

  News:

    * One minor bugfix for the Javascript Interface in older IE browsers.


  Release Notes / Changes from 1.17.5 to 1.17.6:

    * krpano HTML Embedding Script (embedpano.js)
          o Fix: The embedding script of version 1.17.5 was using the wrong
                 Flashplayer embedding method in older IE browsers and this
                 was blocking the external Javascript Interface.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

krpano 1.17.5 / 2014-08-26

  News:

    * Minor bugfixes.
    * Remove Webkit-code that could be problematic in future Chrome versions.
    * Improved Windows Phone support.
    * Improved Linux compatibility (lower GLIBC version).


  Release Notes / Changes from 1.17.4 to 1.17.5:

    * krpano HTML Embedding Script (embedpano.js)
          o Fix: Avoid the usage of Javascript Arrays and 'for in' loops to
                 avoid conflicts with Javascript frameworks that are extending
                 the default Array type.
          o Fix: Do correct Flashplayer embedding even when the Firefox
                 'plugins.enumerable_names' setting is set to empty.

    * krpano HTML5 Viewer (krpano.js)
          o Fix: Remove and replace the usage of the
                 webkitConvertPointFromNodeToPage and
                 webkitConvertPointFromPageToNode functions (they are buggy in
                 Chrome and Safari for scaled pages and will get removed from
                 future Chrome versions).
          o Fix: Improved Windows Phone 8.1 / Mobile Internet Explorer 11
                 support - better mobile viewport, use the device pixels for
                 the WebGL canvas, detect and pass the fake Android device
                 detection from Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1.
          o Fix: Missing mouse.x and mouse.y updates on Windows IE10/IE11
                 devices that support mouse and touch input.
          o Fix: Enable the WebGL 'preserveDrawingBuffer' setting by default
                 for Mac Firefox - it seems to provide more performance and
                 stability there.
          o Fix: Wrong (=one too much) onmousedown event when starting to
                 multitouch in older Android browsers.
          o Fix: Wrong viewport scaling in Android Chrome based browsers in
                 some cases.

    * krpano Flash Viewer (krpano.swf)
          o Fix: The error-case-loading-retry of crossdomain layer/hotspot
                 images that use http queries was causing a Flashplayer script
                 crash.
          o Fix: A very quick loading and unloading of redirected crossdomain
                 images could cause a Flashplayer script crash.

    * Bingmaps Plugin (bingmaps.swf, bingmaps.js)
          o Fix: Avoid the usage of the webkitConvertPoint* functions.
          o Fix: Support using the url placeholders in the spot image urls.

    * Googlemaps Plugin (googlemaps.js)
          o Fix: Avoid the usage of the webkitConvertPoint* functions.
          o Fix: Support using the url placeholders in the spot image urls.

    * Combobox Plugin (combobox.js)
          o Fix: Avoid the usage of the webkitConvertPoint* functions.

    * Videoplayer Plugin (videoplayer.swf, videoplayer.js)
          o Fix: Wrong size of the video in Flash in some cases.

    * krpano Tools
          o Fix: Improved Linux compatibility - the minimum GLIBC version of
                 the krpano command-line tools is now just 2.4 instead of 2.14.
          o Fix: Encrypt tool - automatically use the binary Flash-only
                 encryption mode for .swf files - even when the
                 HTML5-compatible encryption mode is enabled.
          o Fix: Update tool - hanging / not-closeable update dialog when
                 there were no files that could be updated.
          o Fix: Update tool - when updating demo viewer files, set the
                 correct default protection settings.

          o Fix: Enable the same iOS/Safari crashing workaround also for

          o Fix: Wrong multi-resolution tile loading order when using

          o Fix: Wrong automatic text size when the parent elements have zero
                 sizes (Flash).
          o Fix: Hide the textfield when parents elements were invisible until
                 the sizes are known (Flash).

  News:

    * Minor bugfixes and improvements.
    * Several Textfield plugin fixes.

  Release Notes / Changes from 1.17 to 1.17.1:

    * krpano Tools
          o New: Windows HiDPI support for the krpano Testing Server.
          o Change: Avoid the generation of tiles and preview images that have
                    odd sizes (by slightly increasing the sizes in such cases)
                    to avoid this iOS 7 bug:
                    http://krpano.com/ios/bugs/ios7-jpeg-decoding/
          o Change: The size of the preview images of partial and flat panos
                    depends now proportionally on the previewspsize setting
                    (instead of using this size either as width or height).
          o Fix: Wrong GUI scaling on Retina MacBooks.
          o Fix: Wrong button sizes when changing the zoom on Mac.
          o Fix: Skip hidden files (file names which begin with a '.'
                 character) when adding folders.

    * krpano HTML5 Viewer (krpano.js)
          o Fix: Support the viewport scaling of the Samsung Galaxy S5 stock
                 browser.
          o Fix: Changing autoalpha wasn't updating the visible setting in
                 all cases.

                 hotspot.

    * krpano Flash Viewer (krpano.swf)
          o Fix: Small layout updating performance improvements.
          o Fix: Changed plugin onresize event behavior to make it possible
                 to change the plugin size directly inside the event without
                 the need of a full plugin layout recalculation in the next
                 frame (an improvement especially for the textfield plugin
                 when using autowidth/autoheight).
          o Fix: Skip further onresize events when changing the area size and
                 the to-full-pixels rounded area sizes don't change.
          o Fix: Changing autoalpha wasn't updating the visible setting in
                 all cases.
          o Fix: Support the usage of the textfield plugin as distorted
                 hotspot.

                 another.

    * Textfield Plugin (textfield.swf, HTML5:integrated)
          o Change: The HTML5 stagescale behavior works different now -
                    instead of trying to adjust/scale the font-sizes and
                    border/padding sizes by parsing the html content, the
                    whole textfield itself will be scaled by CSS transforms
                    now. This way all html text elements will be scaled the
                    same way by the browser itself.
          o Fix: Slightly wrong padding when using vcenter=true (HTML5).
          o Fix: Links with 'event:' calls were not working when using single
                 quotes.
          o Fix: Performance improvement for the autowidth/autoheight usage
                 (Flash).
          o Fix: Missing size updates when using autoheight=true and
                 dynamically changing the width in some cases (Flash).
          o Fix: A bug related to the internal data-type conversion, which can
                 lead to several strange behaviors when reloading the
                 textfield xml declaration (Flash).
          o Fix: Clickable links (Flash).
          o Fix: Set a default <a> link CSS style (Flash).
          o Fix: Added a workaround for a Flashplayer bug related to missing
                 images.
          o Fix: Don't show popup errors in the Debug Flashplayer when loading
                 an inline image was not possible.
          o Fix: Support the usage as distorted hotspot.

    * Scrollarea Plugin (scrollarea.swf, scrollarea.js)
          o Change: Don't capture the mouse wheel events when mwheel is set
                    to false.

    * Editor Plugin (editor.swf)
          o Fix: Support the new textfield plugin.

    * Droplets / Templates / Skins
          o Change: Scale the defaultskin.xml buttons 2x on mobile devices.
          o Change: Improved flat pano default skin - make sure that the whole
                    image will be seen at startup and adjust the viewing
                    settings during window resizing.

          o Fix: Use the device pixel resolution for WebGL also on Desktop.

                 character code to a string.

                 called when loading new scenes.

          o New: overscroll, friction, acceleration, returnacceleration,

          o Fix: Updated multiframe.config and multiframe.xml files.

                 the current folder as path.
          o Fix: Mac-only - Endless hanging when trying to build more than
                 ~240 files (e.g. tiles in the maketiles or makepano tool) at
                 the same time.

          o Change: When the '-h5' setting will be used, when only the
                    HTML5-compatible encryption will be used. Files that can't
                    be encrypted with that mode will be skipped.
          o Change: Add '.encrypted.*' by default to the encrypted files.
          o Change: Add '.original.*' by default to original files when using
                    the '-rn' setting.

                    another one.

                 mouse.x/mouse.y.
          o Fix: Allow only one touch on a plugin/layer/hotspot at the same
                 time.

krpano 1.16.4 / 2013-06-05

  News:

    * Minor bugfixes and changes.


  Release Notes / Changes from 1.16.3 to 1.16.4:

    * krpano Flash Viewer (krpano.swf)
          o Change: The xml-entity handling for <data> elements was improved
                    for better HTML5-compatibility. Now all <data> elements in
                    a xml file will be pre-processed (CDATA enclosing +
                    manually xml-entity resolving) to provide the same
                    data[...].content values for Flash and HTML5.
                    Warning - there can be side-effects when <data> elements
                    were used also in custom xml structures!
          o Fix: The adjusthlookat() action wasn't working fully correct.

    * krpano HTML5 Viewer (krpanoiphone.js)
          o Change: Use the full/real screen-resolution for the WebGL-
                    rendering on Hi-DPI Android and BlackBerry devices.
          o Change: Whitelist fullscreen-mode-support for Android Chrome 28
                    and higher.
          o Change: Prefer WebGL for Android Firefox 22 or higher (Mozilla has
                    dramatically improved the WebGL performance in this
                    Firefox version).
          o Fix: Added a workaround for the Android Firefox CSS3D pano/layer
                 overlapping problem.
          o Fix: Correct stagescale for Android Chrome 18 based mobile-
                 browsers (e.g. the Samsung Galaxy S4 stock browser).
          o Fix: Correct stagescale for BlackBerry mobiles (Q10, Z10).
          o Fix: Avoid too small values in the CSS3D styles for normal
                 hotspots for correct rendering in all cases.
          o Fix: Filter/skip the first sub-domain when checking for domain-
                 limitations.

    * krpano XML / Actions Interface
          o Change: No 'tween type not found warning' when using an
                    'empty string' or 'null' as tween type. Just use the
                    default tween type 'easeOutQuad' in this case.

    * krpano HTML Embedding (swfkrpano.js)
          o New: html5=fallback setting to prefer Flash and use HTML5 only as
                 fallback.
          o Change: Prefer the HTML5 viewer on mobiles/tablets when using
                    html5=auto.
          o Fix: Ignore supposed successful CSS3D detection in older Android
                 versions (below Android 4.0) on some devices.

    * krpano Tools (all)
          o Fix: License-error problem with embedded HTML5 licenses which have
                 single-quote / apostrophe characters in their registration
                 name.

                 onready embedding callback.
          o Fix: Allow online usage also for demo-version swf files.

    * krpano HTML5 Viewer (krpanoiphone.js)
          o Change: Prefer CSS3D instead of WebGL on Android Stock / WebView-
                    based browsers (some Android devices tend to perform very
                    bad with WebGL).
          o Fix: When using autoheight=true and setting the textfield html
                 setting to empty, then the previous text was still displayed.

                 hotspots for correct rendering in all cases.

          o Fix: Pass xml=null correctly to the Flash viewer.

          o Change: Error messages will be shown with a 500ms delay. This

                    interrupts the downloads when quickly leaving the page.
                    This change applies to fatal-error messages and the
                    log-opening for normal error messages.
          o Fix: mod() with negative values.

    * Bingmaps Plugin (bingmaps.swf)
          o Fix: Avoid Flashplayer crash on large zooms in some cases.

    * Combobox Plugin (combobox.swf)
          o Fix: Update krpano-side item data structures on combobox addItem /
                 addIdItem / removeall calls.

    * Soundinterface Plugin (soundinterface.js)
          o Fix: No Javascript errors when trying to stop pending (iOS) or
                 loading-have-failed sounds.
          o Fix: Pending sounds (iOS) will not start playing anymore on touch
                 after their were actually stopped by a stopsound() call.

    * krpano Tools (all)
          o New: All krpano tools and droplets are signed now for
                 Mac OS X 10.8.
          o Change: krpano Protect Tool - GUI layout adjustments for Mac OS X.
          o Change: krpano Update Tool - GUI layout adjustments for Mac OS X.

    * kmakemultires Tool (Droplets) / kprotectcl Tool
          o Fix: Allow online usage also for demo-version swf files.

    * Examples
          o Fix: Panoramic Videos - videointerface.xml - Correctly sized
                 loading-progress-bar.

    * Templates / Skins
          o Change: vtourskin.xml - Avoid gyro usage on Android devices.
          o Fix: vtourskin.xml - Rename the 'title' variable to 'spottitle'
                 in the 'skin_addmapspots' action to avoid overwritting the
                 tour title when using the tooltips_mapspots setting.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

krpano 1.16.2 / 2013-04-12

  News:

          o Change: The automatic xml-entity resolving for <action>, <data>
                    and <scene> elements was changed for HTML5-compatibility -
                    now only entities inside <action> elements will be
                    automatically resolved.

    * krpano HTML5 Viewer (krpanoiphone.js)
          o New: Adjustable CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) setting for

          o New: Predefined hotspot[...].point array for Flash compatibility.

          o Fix: Automatic xml-entity resolving for <action> elements.
          o Fix: Correct stagescale also without the
                 'target-densitydpi=device-dpi' viewport setting in Android
                 Stock/WebView browsers.
          o Fix: Distorted hotspots were above layers in Android Stock/WebView
                 browsers.
          o Fix: Distorted hotspots weren't distorted in Android Firefox when
                 preferring WebGL.

    * krpano HTML Embedding (swfkrpano.js)
          o Fix: External html5 license loading problem when the viewer-file
                 was loaded before the license-file.
          o Fix: The onready callback works now also in IE6, IE7 and IE8.

          o Fix: Line wasn't drawn (HTML5).

    * kmakemultires Tool (Droplets)
          o Change: When some input panos are not html5-compatible and
                    html5=prefer is used as default embedding setting, then
                    automatically switch to html5=auto (when some of the pano
                    are html5-compatible) or to html5=never (when no pano is
                    html5-compatible).
          o Fix: More informative error message when accidentally trying to
                 use too old krpano viewer files.

                    button on pausedonstart=true (e.g. for iOS).

    * Templates / Skins
          o Change: defaultskin.xml - use the fullscreensupport devices
                    setting for showing the fullscreen buttons.

  Release Notes / Changes from 1.16 to 1.16.1:

          o Fix: Problem when the <scene> onstart attribute contains '&' or
                 '=' characters.
          o Fix: looktohotspot() with polygonal hotspots.

    * krpano HTML5 Viewer (krpanoiphone.js)
          o Fix: Support for older Desktop Safari versions.
          o Fix: Textfield shadow for older Webkit Safari versions.

          o Fix: Disable wmode=direct for older Mac Safari versions.

                 invalid non-numeric fov value.

    * Combobox HTML5 Plugin (combobox.js)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

krpano 1.16 / 2013-03-28

  News:

    * New version numbering scheme: 1.0.8.16 => 1.16
      From now on each krpano release will gets its own unique version number
      to avoid version differences just by the build-date as in some releases
      before.

    * Improved HTML5 Support
          o WebGL support
                + Better rendering performance and quality than CSS-3D
                  in many cases.
                + Will be used automatically (when available and better).
                + Provides better system, browser support - WebGL is much more
                  stable and reliable than CSS-3D.
                + Better image / display quality due Mipmapping - less
                  aliasing and shimmering when mapping large source images to
                  small screen parts.
                + WebGL also makes it possible to support Fisheye /
                  Stereographic/ Pannini / Little-Planet projections also
                  in HTML5.
          o Better Android support
                + More stable and faster rendering in Android-stock /
                  WebView-based browsers.
                + Better Distorted Hotspots clickability.
                + Android Chrome support.
                + Android Firefox support.
                + Android Opera(Webkit) support.
          o Better CSS-3D rendering for Chrome, IE10, iPhone 3GS with iOS6,
            iPod Touch 4 with iOS6 and Android WebView.
          o Better system / device / browser / feature detection.
          o Contextmenu also for HTML5.
          o License-Protection, Branding-Free and krpano Protect Tool support.
          o Touch-Events also for Desktop (Chrome, Firefox, IE10).
          o Improved Textfield plugin support.
          o Support for Mouse-Over/Out events (for Mouse-usage only, will be
            ignored on Touch-usage).
          o Adjustable overall scaling via the stagescale setting.
          o Full <area> support.
          o parent="STAGE" and parent="BGLAYER" support.
          o scale9grid support.
          o BlackBerry support.
          o Support for progress informations .
          o Smaller viewer filesize and better internal structures.

    * Improved Flash Support
          o Updated swf-format (to swf-version 15) - this allows to use newer
            Flashplayer-features like asynchronous image decoding and
            right-click events. Due the new swf format the minimum Flashplayer
            version is now 10.1 (the new embedding script cares about that
            automatically). Therefore also the old Flashplayer-9 compatibility
            code could be removed, which reduced the swf filesize by ~12kb.
          o New custom (=non-native) Contextmenu - looks the same for Flash
            and HTML5. This way also the right-click Fullscreen-option is back
            again.
          o Faster initial multi-resolution loading.
          o No 'local-only' demo-limitation anymore.

    * Improved Viewer (XML Interface)
          o New layout possibilities - when using negative sizes for
            width/height - then the resulting size will be the size of the
            parent-element minus the given size.
          o New delayedcall() and stopdelayedcall() actions.
          o New escape() and unescape() actions.
          o The scale9grid setting can now be used together with the crop
            setting.
          o Support for parameters (%0,%1,...) also for 'inline-actions'
            (these are actions / action-codes that are stored in normal
            variables/attributes).
          o Several new devices and device settings (e.g. webgl, androidstock,
            chrome, ...).
          o Faster action-parsing and faster action-execution.
          o The fisheye rendering works/looks slightly different now - it
            allows viewing more than 180 degrees - this change was necessary
            for Flash/HTML5 compatibility. For the same reason the
            view.limitfov setting, that was limiting the fov in fisheye mode,
            was removed. The stereographic rendering is not affected by these
             changes.

    * Improved Plugins
          o All krpano HTML5 plugins are now compatible with the IE10 touch
            events and allow mouse and touch usage at the same time (e.g. for
            desktop touch devices).
          o The ScrollArea Plugin has got new functions - automatic scrolling
            via mouse-hovering and interfaces for manual-scrolling via
            external buttons.

    * Improved Tools / Droplets / Templates / Default-Skins
          o The krpano Protect Tool supports also the krpano HTML5 viewer now
            - that means license-embedding, domain-limitations, expire-dates,
            private-encrypted-files and branding-free also for HTML5.
          o New [HTML5] placeholder and htmltemplate_html5 setting.
          o New custom html and xml template placeholders.
          o The default virtual-tour-skin has got several new features and
            settings.

                 settings.

                 fontweight, fontstyle).
          o Fix: Detect only left-mouse button clicks as clicks.
          o Fix: keepview behavior - every pano needs to define its own
                 viewing limitations.
          o Fix: Firefox mouse-wheel-event listening 'ordered behind' to allow
                 stopping wheel events by plugins like the Bingmaps plugin.

    * Bing Maps Plugin (bingmaps.swf, bingmap.js)
          o New: Firefox, IE10, Opera support (button graphics, touch events)

          o Fix: seek(0) + pause() could cause an invisible video when using
                 distorted hotspots (Flash).

          o New: The tools will now automatically call the 'purge' command on
                 Mac on low-memory situations to get more free system memory
                 and avoid getting into swapping.
          o Change: Different memory-management for Mac and Linux - the tools
                    should now use more system memory before starting to
                    swap-out memory.

    * kencrypt Tool
          o New: HTML5 support for private xml-encryption.

          o HTML5 Fullscreen API support.
          o Android 4.x support.
          o Bing Maps for HTML5 (iPhone/iPad).
          o More HTML5 embedding / detection settings.
          o Support for the iOS 6 Landscape Fullscreen Mode and the new
            iOS 6 url-bar hiding.
          o Better distorted hotspots support and better click/touch detection.

    * New and Improved Plugins
          o New Bing Maps Plugin for HTML5 (iPhone/iPad).
          o New ScrollArea Plugin for automatic touch/drag-scrolling.
          o New Virtual Tour Editor Plugin for editing MAKE VTOUR tours.
          o Combobox - HTML5 Plugin with Retina support, improved rendering
            performance and customizable graphics.
          o Soundinterface - support for alternative audio codecs (like Ogg
            for HTML5 Firefox).
          o Textfield - better Flash/HTML5 compatibility (almost pixel
            perfect), vcenter and autoheight settings, better text and
            rounded-edge quality, advanced shadow and textshadow support.
          o Videoplayer - support for alternative video codecs.

    * Improved Viewer (XML Interface / Layout)
          o New <layer> elements (same as the <plugin> elements, just a
            new/different name).
          o Automatic 'sub-layering' (parent-assignment) of elements by
            defining elements inside other elements.
            <layer name="container" ...>
                <layer name="child1" ... />
                <layer name="child2" ... />
            </layer>
          o New container plugin/layer elements. These elements are like
            normal plugin/layer elements, just without any image url setting
            and a type="container" setting instead. These container elements
            can be used to hold or group other elements. To mask children
            elements use the maskchildren setting. A background color can be

            settings. To make the background clickable enable the bgcapture
            setting.
          o Performance optimized parent/child system - when moving a parent
            element, the children elements don't need to be updated. This
            allows an very efficient movement of several elements at once.
          o New and updated viewer examples.

           (for HTML5 support).
          o Define any additional custom image sizes with additional
            customized xml tags (for automatically generating special sized
            images for certain devices).
          o EXIF GPS support - automatically transfer the GPS informations
            from the input image to the xml. Customizable via placeholders.
          o New automatic level sizes adjustment for multiresolution images
            for better loading and rendering performance.
          o Support for outputting progressive-encoded jpeg images.

    * krpano Flash Viewer (krpano.swf)
          o New: device object for checking the current device and its
                 properties. This device object is the dynamic/scripting
                 equivalent to the xml devices attribute.
          o New: Additional device properties: fullscreensupport, ipod,
                 windows, mac, linux.
          o New: Use the Browsers Mouse Wheel Events when available (through
                 the swfkrpano.js script) instead of the Flashplayer Wheel
                 Event. They are more accurate and have a better cross-systems
                 / cross-browser support. The non-rounded, non-integer numeric
                 wheeldelta value is available via the new wheeldelta_raw
                 value.
          o New: Since Flashplayer version 11.3 the Fullscreen Mode can't be
                 changed anymore from the right-click context-menu. Therefore
                 the fullscreen-item in the context-menu is disabled by
                 default now.
          o Fix: The click events of elements that had children elements were
                 not working correctly in some situations.
          o Fix: Missing updates/redraws of children elements when changing
                 the parent element in some situations.
          o Fix: Container elements were always scaled from left-top instead
                 from the edge point.
          o Fix: Hotspot update/redraw when changing the url during loading
                 the current file.
          o Fix: When using autorotate and usercontrol=off, then any
                 user-input is correctly ignored now and will not pause the
                 autorotation.
          o Fix: The system mouse cursor had become visible after the
                 context-menu usage when using custom-cursors.
          o Fix: The style setting was wrongly 'null' after loading.
          o Fix: The changeorigin() action works now also for children
                 elements.
          o Fix: Explicitly verify the availability of the Flashplayer
                 External-Interface (because in some situations the
                 Flashplayer reports a wrong availability).
          o Fix: Plugin-Interface - call the unloadplugin function before
                 removing the plugin from the Flash stage (to allow the plugin
                 accessing the stage in the unloadplugin function).

    * krpano HTML5 Viewer (krpanoiphone.js)
          o New: HTML5 Fullscreen API support.

          o Fix: The style setting was wrongly 'null' after loading.
          o Fix: The changeorigin() action works now also for children
                 elements.
          o Fix: Wrong movements with usercontrol=off.
          o Fix: Stop mouse panning friction during gesture zooming.
          o Fix: Same mouse-wheel zooming speed for Flash and HTML5 on all
                 browsers.
          o Fix: Automatic workaround (html5rendermode=2) for graphics errors
                 on iPhone 3GS and iPod Touch 4.Gen with iOS 6.0.

          o Fix: Chrome Linux - visible cube-edges.
          o Fix: Urlbar hiding for iOS 3.1.
          o Fix: Firefox - xml-parsing-error detection.

                 files).

    * krpano HTML Embedding (swfkrpano.js)
          o New: Completely new Mouse Wheel Events handling. Always catch and

          o New: Direct clicking on the zoomtrack control changes the zoom.
          o Fix: Better cross-system / cross-browser mouse-wheel support.
                 Detect smooth-mouse-wheel / touchpad-scrolling for direct
                 smooth map zooming.
          o Fix: Zoom-out from the map-center instead from the cursor position
                 on 'stepwise' mouse-wheel events.
          o Fix: Several zooming fixes, avoid invisible tiles.
          o Fix: Avoid crashes on 'empty' spot/spotstyle elements.

                 textfield will be changed (when using autoheight=true).
          o Fix: Avoid crash when html=data:... or css=data:... without
                 existing data (Flash).

            on PPC Macs.
          o Dynamic file management (only for jpeg tiles at the moment) to
            avoid opening too much files at once (important for Mac where only

          o Fix: The thumbnails/map 'state' values were changed from
                 'visible'/'hidden' to 'opened'/'close' (the usage of
                 'visible' was problematic in some cases).

                 only the scene title.
          o Fix: vtour_scenetemplate.xml - use filtered [BASENAME] as scene
                 name to avoid xml problems.
